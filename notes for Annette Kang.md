# Notes on Biodiversity Datamining Project for Annette Kang

Prepared by Aubrey Moore, May 18, 2021; Updated May 24, 2021

## Project Proposal

This is a component of the 
[Guam Forest Biodiversity Inventory](https://github.com/aubreymoore/Miscellaneous-Docs-for-CFES2018/raw/master/ms_proposal_2018.pdf)
which is an approved by McIntire Stennis project.

## Initial Data Sources for Legacy Literature Datamining 

* [Insects of Guam I](http://hbs.bishopmuseum.org/pubs-online/bpbm-bulletins.html) Scroll down to Vulume 172 to see contents.
* [Insects of Guam II](http://hbs.bishopmuseum.org/pubs-online/bpbm-bulletins.html) Scroll down to Volume 189 to see contents.

Project funds were used to pay the Bishop Museum to make these volumes publicly available by converting them to PDF files which are hosted on the Museums web site. The objective of this datamining project is to extract data from **Insects of Guam** so that they can be uploaded to **GBIF** and used to build the **Guam Forest Biodiversity Inventory**. 
 
## Software Tools

### Golden Gate Imagine (GGI)

* [Download page](http://plazi.org/resources/treatmentbank/goldengate-editor/)
* The [GGI community portal](https://github.com/plazi/community) provides training materials and more.

#### Example Usage

The Thrips of Guam chapter in Insects of Guam I was annotated by GGI, the data were published in [this Zenodo journal article](https://zenodo.org/record/3634035#.YKNHgiYRXS8), they were also automatically uploaded to a [GBIF dataset](https://www.gbif.org/dataset/9c8d5683-76c1-4938-aede-b7ad5391b6b2). So this can be done. Just a matter of learning how.
