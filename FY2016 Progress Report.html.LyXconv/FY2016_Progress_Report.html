Target Audience:I provided information to the Guam Plant Extinction Prevention Project staff and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service staff at the Guam National Wildlife Refuge. This information included identification of insect specimens given to me and recommendations on plant protection. Fact sheets on newly arrived invasive species were prepared and made available to the public in print and on web site. Changes/Problems:A planned visit by an insect taxonomist to assist in identification of a large backlog in the University of Guam Insect Collection did not happen during the reporting period because of schedualing problems. A visit by a taxonomist is being planned for 2016. What opportunities for training and professional development has the project provided?Informal training in insect specimen collection and preservation was provided to staff of the Guam Plant Extinction Prevention Pogram (GPEPP) during several visits to the project’s nursery and field sites. In some cases, pest control recommendations were provided. How have the results been disseminated to communities of interest?Fact sheets on newly arrived invasive insect species were prepared and these are available to the public in print and on-line. What do you plan to do during the next reporting period to accomplish the goals?I plan to offer a workshop to staff of the Guam Department of Agriculture Forestry Division on survey and collection methods for forest insect pests. I plan to submit two refereed journal articles on recently arrived bark beetles species. I plan to host a visiting taxonomist to help identify a large backlog of unidentified specimens submitted to the University of Guam Insect Collection. A student technician will be hired to coincide with the taxonomist’s visit.

What was accomplished under these goals? A web application named CheckList Plus (CLP) was designed and developed to faciliate databasing and accessing information on Guam’s forest pests. All organisms in CLP are linked to taxa in the taxonomy database maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The NCBI taxonomy database is essentially a digitized tree of life which includes scientific names and synonyms including common names. Unlike many biodiversity databases, CLP allows definiton of trophic links between taxa. This allows queries to find all insect herbivores which feed on a particular host plant, or conversely, to find all host plants on which a particular insect feeds. The CLP is currently being populated with data from several sources: the scientific literature and specimen data from the University of Guam Insect Collection. Many specimens of forest insect pests collected by the Guam Plant Extinction Prevention Program, the Guam National Wildlife Refuge, and other collaborators were accessioned into the University of Guam Insect Collection during the reporting period. Most of these specimens await identification by a taxonomist.
