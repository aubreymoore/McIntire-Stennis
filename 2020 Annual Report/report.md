No signifacant progress on this project was made during FY2020 because work and travel were impeded by the COVID-19 pandemic:
* Plans to continue digitization of the University of Guam insect collection using student interns was cancelled because the University was closed.
* Plans to participate in the 4th iDigBio Annual Digital Data Conference were abandoned which was to be held at Indiana University were abandoned.
