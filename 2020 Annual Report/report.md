Little progress on this project was made during FY2020 because work and travel were impeded by the COVID-19 pandemic:
* Plans to continue digitization of the University of Guam insect collection using student interns was cancelled because the University was closed.
* Plans to participate in the 4th iDigBio Annual Digital Data Conference which was to be held at Indiana University were abandoned.

Insect occurrence records for Guam continue to accumulate in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) [1]. Most records are from data sources maintained by this McIntire-Stennis project.
* GBIF currently reports 18,604 Guam insect ocurrence records which include 16 orders, 228 families, 620 genera, and 1035 species.
* 15,136 records were sourced from the University of Guam Insect Collection online catalog.
* 457 records were sourced from iNaturalist Research-grade observations. Most of these are from the iNaturalist Insects of Micronesia Project.
