<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-1.1">1.1</a> Objective: Complete digitization of the UOG insect collection 
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
The UOG insect collection catalog has already been made available online using Symbiota. Note that Symbiota automatically uploads data to GBIF. The next phase of this digitization project will be imaging of all taxa in the collection. Existing images will be uploaded and linked to specimen data. Images will be made for taxa which have not been previously imaged and these will also be uploaded.

<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-1.2">1.2</a> Objective: Complete digitization of the UOG herbarium 
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
Digital images are available for all herbarium sheets. The existing herbarium catalog will be converted from a local database to an online database using Symbiota or Specify. Both of these online collection database managers automatically upload to GBIF.

<div class="Unindented">
The PI will organize extraction of Guam biodiversity information from primary scientific publications, starting with Insects of Guam I and II.

</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
The PI will launch a web site to serve as a portal to Guam forest biodiversity data stored in GBIF. Pages will be developed to dynamically generate lists such as those suggested above.

<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-3.1">3.1</a> Objective: Outreach and Citizen Science Activities
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
The PI will offer annual workshops on the use of iNaturalist, a social networking app used by citizen scientists and naturalists which enables them to record biodiversity observations with images and georeferencing using smart phones. iNaturalist data which is validated as research grade by the community is automatically uploaded to GBIF. 
</li>
<li>
The PI will continue to maintain an iNaturalist project entitled Insects of Micronesia. 
</li>
<li>
The PI will work with the UOG Center for Island Sustainability to organize annual bioblitzes. A bioblitz is is an intense period of biological surveying in an attempt to record all the living species within a designated area. Participants in the bioblitzes will be trained to use iNaturalist which will be used to document results. 
</li>

<h2 class="Subsection">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-4.1">4.1</a> Objective: Collaboration with taxonomists, collectors and the biodiversity informatics community
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Collaboration with taxonomists will be cultivated to help identify a large backlog of unidentified specimens in the UOG insect collection. 
</li>
<li>
Existing collaboration will be maintained with existing partners list in the Collaboration/Cooperation section of this proposal. 
</li>
<li>
The PI will participate in at least one scientific meeting per year covering biological collections and/or biodiversity informatics. 
</li>
<li>
The PI will encourage donation of voucher specimens to the UOG insect collection from biological surveys such as those being conducted by the Ecology of Bird Loss and the baseline surveys being done by military contractors in support of the military buildup.
