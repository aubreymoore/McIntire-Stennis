</h1>
<div class="Unindented">
Funding is requested to support building and maintenance of a Guam Forest Biodiversity Inventory. In its simplest form, a biodiversity inventory is simple a checklist of taxa inhabiting a geographic area or habitat of interest. In this case the habitat of interest is Guam’s forests. If funded, this project will be a major component of a larger project aimed at building a Guam Terrestrial Biodiversity Inventory to include all taxa found on the island.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
Guam’s forest ecosystems are rapidly being degraded by invasive insect species and habitat destruction. Impacts of bird extinctions caused by brown treesnake predation on Guam’s forests are well known. But these impacts are rivaled by contemporary ecological disasters. A couple of examples:
</div>
<ol>
<li>
In 2002, a USDA Forest Service survey <span class="bibcites">[<a class="bibliocite" name="cite-1" href="#biblio-1"><span class="bib-index">1</span></a>]</span> reported that Guam’s endemic cycad, <i>Cycas micronesica</i>, was the most abundant tree (DBH &gt; 5 inches) in Guam’s forests. In 2003 the Asian cycad scale, <i>Aulacaspis yasumatsui</i>, was detected on Guam infesting ornamental cycads. The scale quickly spread to wild cycads and started killing them. Within only 3 years, <i>Cycas micronesica</i> was placed on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species and in 2016, this plant was placed on the US national endangered species list. It is estimated that 90% of Guam’s cycads have been killed and there is no sign of recovery.
</li>
<li>
The same Forest Service survey listed coconut palm, <i>Cocos nucifera</i>, as Guam’s second most abundant tree. Guam’s palms are rapidly being killed by coconut rhinoceros beetle, <i>Oryctes rhinoceros</i>, first detected on the island in 2007. It is likely that 50% or more of the island’s coconut palms will be lost.
</li>

</ol>
<div class="Unindented">
Despite rapid destruction of Guam’s forests, as illustrated by these 2 examples, we do not have even a basic checklist which can be used to document changes in biodiversity.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
A biodiversity inventory is needed:
</div>
<ul>
<li>
to document changes to Guam’s ecosystems
</li>
<li>
to document detection of and impacts caused by invasive species which are arriving at a rapid rate
</li>
<li>
to provide free, open access to information on Guam’s flora and fauna (including images and occurrence maps) to the global scientific community, policy makers, and the public
</li>
<li>
to act as a digital repository for data from biological surveys and biological collections
</li>
<li>
to provide links to scientific literature about taxa which occur on Guam
</li>
<li>
to document ecological relationships among taxa such as hosts, predators, parasites, and diseases
</li>

</ul>
<div class="Unindented">
<p><br/>
</p>
The Guam Forest Biodiversity Inventory will use the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) as a repository. A custom web site will be built by the PI to serve as a public interface to Guam biodiversity data stored on GBIF. Darwin Core Archives (DwCA) will be used extensively for transferring data to and from GBIF.<a class="Label" name="lists"> </a>
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The Guam Biodiversity Inventory will facilitate automatic generation and updates to lists such as: 
</div>
<ul>
<li>
A list of all invasive species on Guam with year first recorded 
</li>
<li>
A list of new species described from specimens collected on Guam 
</li>
<li>
A list of observations for Guam’s endangered species 
</li>
<li>
A list of Guam’s forest plants with associated herbivores and pathogens 
</li>
<li>
A list of forest pests and associated biological control agents 
</li>
<li>
A literature reference list and links to images for all taxa in the database
</li>
<li>
Customizable checklists and field guides with images
</li>

</ul>
<h1 class="Section">
<a class="toc" name="toc-Section-2">2</a> Previous Work and Present Outlook 
</h1>
<ul>
<li>
This proposal evolves from the PI’s previous McIntire-Stennis project entitled <i>Guam Forest Insect Survey.</i>
</li>
<li>
The entire UOG insect collection catalog (34,808 specimen records) has recently been put online at <a class="FlexURL" href="http://scan-bugs.org/portal/collections/misc/collprofiles.php?collid=180">http://scan-bugs.org/portal/collections/misc/collprofiles.php?collid=180</a> Digital images will be added.
</li>
<li>
The PI recently accessioned over 5,000 specimens of insect seed predators from Benita Laird-Hopkins research, part of the Ecology of Bird Loss Project. This records are available in the UOG insect collection online catalog.
</li>
<li>
The PI recently put 37,000 digital images of UOG herbarium sheets online at <a class="FlexURL" href="https://osf.io/qdg46/?view_only=c39ff58ac28b4bee94dc231b3f2bef95">https://osf.io/qdg46/?view_only=c39ff58ac28b4bee94dc231b3f2bef95</a>. Next step is to link these images with the herbarium database.
</li>
<li>
The PI designed the Guam Terrestrial Biodiversity Inventory and made a presentation on this at the recent Guam Island Sustainability Conference <span class="bibcites">[<a class="bibliocite" name="cite-2" href="#biblio-2"><span class="bib-index">2</span></a>]</span>.
</li>
<li>
The PI has contracted the Bishop Museum to make PDFs of primary entomological literature for Guam, namely <i>Insects of Guam I and Insects of Guam II. </i>These<i> </i>volumes will be made available for public download from the Bishop Museum web site. These books will be data mined for forest biodiversity information.
</li>
<li>
The PI recently established an internship so that students can assist in curating the UOG insect collection.
</li>
<li>
The PI is skilled at scientific programming, web design, database design, and database management. This project will use free open source software (FOSS) and free or low cost web hosting. External technical support will not be required.
</li>

<a class="toc" name="toc-Subsection-3.4">3.4</a> Outreach / Citizen Science
</h2>
<div class="Unindented">
The PI will offer annual workshops on the use of iNaturalist, a social networking app used by citizen scientists and naturalists which enables them to record biodiversity observations with images and georeferencing using smart phones. iNaturalist data which is validated as <i>research grade</i> by the community is automatically uploaded to GBIF. The PI maintains an iNaturalist project entitled <a class="URL" href="https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/insects-of-micronesia">Insects of Micronesia</a>.
</div>
<div class="Indented">
The PI will work with the UOG Center for Island Sustainability to organize annual bioblitzes. A <a class="URL" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioBlitz">bioblitz</a> is is an intense period of biological surveying in an attempt to record all the living species within a designated area.
